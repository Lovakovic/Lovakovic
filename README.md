# Hello there, I'm Dario!

I'm a master's degree student in Information Security & Digital Forensics at Zagreb University of Applied Sciences. I also have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

## What I'm Working On 💻

I'm working mostly with **Node.js**, **Angular** and **NestJS**.

I'm currently working on **deta-pal** - a web application for reducing repetitive everyday activities by using LLMs (whatever comes onto my mind).

I also have one _finished_ project: **ScamAlert**, a browser extension aimed at detecting malicious sites and alerting users. This project was initially developed as a part of my "Završni rad" (final project), and now I'm in the process of enhancing it and porting it to Chrome. 🚀🛡️

Check out the repositories on my profile for more details on these exciting projects!
