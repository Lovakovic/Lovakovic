# Hello there, I'm Dario! 👋

I'm currently a third-year Computer Science student at the Zagreb University of Applied Sciences, planning to continue on to postgraduate studies in Cyber Security and Digital Forensics. 👨‍💻📚

## What I'm Working On 💻🛠️

I'm presently focusing on Java and am involved in developing two fullstack web applications:

1. A web application built with **MySQL + EAN (Express.js, Angular, and Node.js)**. 🌐🔨
2. Another project based on **MySQL, Spring Boot, and Angular**. 🚀📈
3. I semi-regularly upload **Bash scripts** that I use and create.

You can find more about these projects in my repositories.

## My Future Plans 🔭🔬

Right not I'm mainly focused on coding in ☕ **Java** ☕ in general, and I'm just diving deeper into its exciting world. I'm also exploring PyTorch and training a few models right now. My interests are quickly moving towards Generative Models, and I'm really excited to dive deep into them! 🧠💡
