# 👋 Hey there, I'm Dario!

Crafting autonomous AI agents by day, breaking boundaries between human intent and machine execution by night. Soon-to-be MSc in Information Security & Digital Forensics, but my real passion? Making AI do the heavy lifting in our daily digital lives.

## 🤖 What I Build

I specialize in creating autonomous AI agents and practical AI-powered tools. My playground:

- **axiom**: A high-autonomy CLI agent that turns natural language into system commands. No guardrails, maximum power. My daily driver for when typing commands feels too 2024.
- **realtime-voice-bot**: Meet Ema, my AI secretary who actually picks up the phone! Call her at `+385 35 894 0006` (she prefers English, but she's working on her Croatian). She'll make sure your message reaches me... unless she's on a coffee break! ☕
- **data-pal**: The next evolution in AI-enhanced productivity (React + AI = 🚀)

## 🛠️ Tech Arsenal

- **Backend**: Node.js & NestJS - Because JavaScript on steroids is still king
- **Frontend**: Angular & React - Double the frameworks, double the fun
- **AI Integration**: Turning powerful language models into practical tools
- **Scripting**: Python when I need to move fast and break things (responsibly)

## 💡 What I'm About

I'm all about that sweet spot where AI meets everyday utility. While my academic papers say "Digital Forensics", my heart beats for creating AI agents that make our digital lives smoother. I build tools that bridge the gap between "wouldn't it be cool if..." and "holy shit, it actually works!"

Want to see AI do more than just chat? Give Ema a call or check out my repos - especially if you're into autonomous agents or making AI actually useful in the real world! 🚀
