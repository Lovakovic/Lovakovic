- Hi, I’m @Lovakovic
- I’m a third-year Program Engineering student at Zagreb University of Applied Sciences
- I'm interested in learning about wide range of Computer Science topics, but currently I'm focused on full stack web applications and neural networks
- Currently I don't have any projects of mine that I'd like to collaborate on as I'm still mostly in the learning phase of most technologies I use. However I am planning on starting one project related to phishing prevention soon, so this might change in future!
