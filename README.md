# Hello there, I'm Dario!

I have recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Zagreb University of Applied Sciences. Now, I'm embarking on my postgraduate journey in Computer Security and Digital Forensics at the college.

## What I'm Working On 💻

I've shifted my focus towards **Node.js** and **Angular** development, and am actively involved in two main projects currently:

1. A web application built with **Angular, Node.js (NestJS), and MySQL** called CashCompass. 🌐🔨
2. **ScamAlert**, a browser extension aimed at detecting malicious sites and alerting users. This project was initially developed as a part of my "Završni rad" (final project), and now I'm in the process of enhancing it and porting it to Chrome. 🚀🛡️

Check out the repositories on my profile for more details on these exciting projects!

## My Future Plans 🔭

I am eagerly looking forward to delving into some machine learning projects in the near future, with a keen interest in exploring Generative Models further. While I am immersing myself in the world of Node.js and Angular at present, the realms of machine learning and AI continue to pique my curiosity. 🧠💡
