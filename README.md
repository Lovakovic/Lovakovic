- Hi, I’m @Lovakovic
- I’m interested in learning about wide range of Computer Science topics, but currently I'm focused on neural networks and frontend web frameworks.
- I'm also interested in learning more about backend frameworks such as Django with Python and genetic algorithms
- Currently I don't have any projects of mine that I'd like to collaborate on as I'm still mostly in the learning phase of most technologies I use. However I am planning on starting one project related to phishing prevention soon, so this might change in future!
